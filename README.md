<h1>Avalonia Cross-Platform example app</h1>

Simple application to demostrate how to use Avalonia to create cross-platform application. This application was tested running in Windows 10, MacOS Big Sur and Ubuntu 20.04.
This application used some good practices and has a Common project with some useful classes for all further projects. Also is loading a UserControl into MainWindow view to make easy and smoothly navigation.
A second UserSontrol was added in the project Component to load images and create Image control dynamically.
